# so what exactly the correction script is doing

Let me explain exactly what the correction script is doing step by step. The goal of the script is to **fix the labels in your dataset** by extracting the actual text labels from image filenames and creating a new, properly formatted dataset.

---

### **What the Script Does**

The script processes your dataset folder (`data/dataset`) and performs the following tasks for each split (`train`, `val`, `test`):

1. **Extract Text Labels from Filenames**:
    - Each image filename follows a pattern like:

```
115_Lube_45484.jpg
```

    - The script extracts the **middle part** of the filename (e.g., `Lube`) as the text label for that image. This is done using the `extract_label_from_filename` function:

```python
def extract_label_from_filename(filename):
    parts = filename.split("_")
    if len(parts) &gt;= 3:  # Ensure filename follows expected pattern
        return parts[1]  # Return middle segment (text label)
    else:
        print(f"⚠️ Bad filename format: {filename}")
        return ""
```

2. **Copy Images to a New Directory**:
    - The script copies each image from its original location (`data/dataset/train/images`) to a new directory (`data/dataset_fixed/train/images`). This ensures that the corrected dataset has a clean structure.
3. **Create New Labels File (`labels.txt`)**:
    - For each image, the script writes a line in the new `labels.txt` file with the format:

```
&lt;image_filename&gt;    &lt;text_label&gt;
```

    - Example:

```
115_Lube_45484.jpg    Lube
114_Spencerian_73323.jpg    Spencerian
```

4. **Multithreading for Speed**:
    - To speed up processing, the script uses multithreading with `ThreadPoolExecutor`. Each thread processes one image and its label simultaneously.

---

### **Detailed Breakdown of Each Step**

#### **Step 1: Extract Text Labels**

The script reads each line from the original `labels.txt` file, which looks like this:

```
115_Lube_45484.jpg    45484
114_Spencerian_73323.jpg    73323
```

It ignores the numeric label (`45484`, `73323`) and instead extracts the actual text (`Lube`, `Spencerian`) from the filename using string manipulation.

#### **Step 2: Copy Images**

For each image, the script copies it to a new directory (`data/dataset_fixed/train/images`). This ensures that your corrected dataset is stored separately from the original dataset.

#### **Step 3: Write Corrected Labels**

The script writes a new `labels.txt` file for each split (`train`, `val`, `test`) with corrected labels. For example:

```
115_Lube_45484.jpg    Lube
114_Spencerian_73323.jpg    Spencerian
```


#### **Step 4: Multithreading**

To speed up processing, multiple threads handle copying images and writing labels simultaneously. This is helpful when dealing with large datasets because I/O operations (like reading/writing files) can be slow.

---

### **Why This Script is Necessary**

Your original labels file contains numeric labels like this:

```
115_Lube_45484.jpg    45484
```

These numeric labels are incorrect for OCR training because they don't represent the actual text content of the images (e.g., "Lube", "Spencerian").

OCR models need text labels to learn how to recognize characters and words. The correction script fixes this issue by extracting text labels from filenames and creating properly formatted labels files.

---

### **Final Output**

After running this script, your corrected dataset will look like this:

#### Directory Structure:

```
data/
└── dataset_fixed/
    ├── train/
    │   ├── images/
    │   │   ├── 115_Lube_45484.jpg
    │   │   ├── 114_Spencerian_73323.jpg
    │   │   └── ...
    │   └── labels.txt
    ├── val/
    │   ├── images/
    │   └── labels.txt
    └── test/
        ├── images/
        └── labels.txt
```


#### Content of `labels.txt` (Example):

```
115_Lube_45484.jpg    Lube
114_Spencerian_73323.jpg    Spencerian
113_accommodatingly_613.jpg    accommodatingly
112_CARPENTER_11682.jpg    CARPENTER
111_REGURGITATING_64100.jpg    REGURGITATING
```

### **Why Multithreading is Used**

Multithreading speeds up tasks like:

- Reading files (`labels.txt`)
- Copying images to new directories
- Writing corrected labels to new files

Instead of processing one image at a time, multiple threads process images simultaneously, reducing overall runtime.

### Next Steps

1. Run the script using:

```bash
python fix_labels.py
```

2. Verify that your corrected dataset is stored in `data/dataset_fixed`.
3. Check that `labels.txt` files contain proper text labels extracted from filenames.
4. Use this corrected dataset for training your OCR model.
