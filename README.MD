## Introduction
This OCR model is designed to recognize and extract text from images. It leverages the power of PyTorch to build and train deep learning models for accurate text recognition.

## Installation
To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```

## Usage
To use the OCR model, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ocr-model.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd ocr-model
    ```
3. Run the OCR script on an image:
    ```bash
    python ocr.py --image path/to/your/image.jpg
    ```

## Model Architecture
The OCR model is built using a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to effectively recognize text in images. The architecture includes:
- Convolutional layers for feature extraction
- Recurrent layers for sequence modeling
- Fully connected layers for character classification

## Training
To train the OCR model, use the following command:
```bash
python train.py --data path/to/dataset --epochs 50
```
Ensure you have a dataset of labeled images for training.

## Evaluation
To evaluate the performance of the OCR model, run:
```bash
python evaluate.py --data path/to/testset
```
This will provide metrics such as accuracy and loss.
